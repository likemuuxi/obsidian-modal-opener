# ðŸ¥°Special thanks

Special thanks to these amazing plugins! I use these plugins as a reference for developing my first public plugin. The basic structure of this plugin is mainly based on [obidian link opener](https://github.com/zorazrr/obsidian-link-opener). I referred to other plugins and completed the modal window file display and prevent duplicate tabs functions, The list of plug-ins is as follows.
