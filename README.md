# Special Thanks

Special thanks to these amazing plugins! I used these plugins as a reference for developing my first public plugin. The plugin basic structure is mainly based on the [obsidian-link-opener](https://github.com/zorazrr/obsidian-link-opener). I referred to other plugins and completed the display of files in the modal window and plugin restart function.
