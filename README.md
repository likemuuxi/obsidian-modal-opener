# üößCompatibility

Currently known plugins with conflicts.

- `no dupe leave`
- `mononote`

The above plugins are all for handling duplicate tabs, now the plugin has a built-in duplicate tab detection function, which comes from the `mononote` plugin and has been modified on the basis of the original one.

> Notice: When loading a Web page using the `surfing` plugin, do not turn on the **option to open a web page in a fixed and unique tab**. This affects the plugin's functionality.

# ü•∞Special thanks

Special thanks to these amazing plugins! I use these plugins as a reference for developing my first public plugin. The basic structure of this plugin is mainly based on [obidian link opener](https://github.com/zorazrr/obsidian-link-opener). I referred to other plugins and completed the modal window file display and prevent duplicate tabs functions, The list of plug-ins is as follows.
